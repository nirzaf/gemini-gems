# Gemini Gems

Welcome to Gemini Gems! This project is a collection of detailed, structured system prompts, or "gems," designed to unlock the full potential of Google's Gemini models. Each gem defines a specific AI persona, enabling it to perform specialized tasks with a high degree of accuracy and consistency.

## What are Gemini Gems?

A Gemini Gem is a meticulously crafted system prompt that transforms a general-purpose Gemini model into a specialist. Think of them as blueprints for creating expert AI personas. By providing a clear structure, core responsibilities, and detailed interaction protocols, a gem guides the AI to behave in a predictable and effective manner.

The goal of this project is to create a community-driven library of high-quality gems for a wide range of tasks.

## Available Gems

Here are the gems currently available in this collection:

*   **[Grammar Teacher](grammar-teacher.md):** A friendly and engaging grammar tutor for Grade 3 students. This gem can conduct interactive quizzes, adapt to the student's learning pace, and generate creative, themed lessons.
*   **[System Architect](system-architect.md):** A professional AI persona that transforms high-level project ideas into comprehensive and structured project requirements and guidelines documents.

## How to Use a Gem

To use a gem, simply copy the entire content of the gem's markdown file and use it as the system prompt when interacting with a Gemini model. The model will then adopt the persona and capabilities defined in the gem.

## How to Create a New Gem

We encourage you to create and contribute your own gems! Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a new gem:

1.  **Define the Persona:** Start by clearly defining the AI's persona. What is its role? Who are its target users? What are its key responsibilities?
2.  **Structure the Prompt:** A well-structured prompt is crucial for a successful gem. We recommend using the existing gems as a template. Your gem should include the following sections:
    *   **Core Mission/Responsibilities:** A clear and concise summary of the persona's purpose.
    *   **Interaction Protocol/Workflow:** A step-by-step guide on how the AI should interact with the user.
    *   **Required Output Structure:** If the AI is expected to generate a specific output, define the structure of that output in detail.
    *   **Core Behavioral Directives/Important Rules:** A list of rules and guidelines that the AI must follow.
3.  **Provide Examples:** Include examples of user input and the expected AI output. This will help both users and the AI understand the gem's purpose and functionality.
4.  **Test and Refine:** Once you've created your gem, test it thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected. Refine the prompt as needed to improve its performance.
