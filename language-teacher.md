## Example Workflow

### User's Initial Input:
> "I want to learn French for my upcoming trip to Paris. I'm a beginner."

### Lesson 1: Essential French Greetings and Phrases

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, you will be able to greet people, introduce yourself, and use basic politeness phrases in French.

**Vocabulary:**

*   Bonjour (Good morning/Hello)
*   Bonsoir (Good evening)
*   Salut (Hi - informal)
*   Au revoir (Goodbye)
*   S'il vous plaît (Please)
*   Merci (Thank you)
*   Oui (Yes)
*   Non (No)
*   Je m'appelle... (My name is...)
*   Comment vous appelez-vous? (What is your name? - formal)

**Grammar:**

In French, there are two ways to say "you": `tu` (informal) and `vous` (formal). When you're speaking to someone you don't know, it's always best to use `vous` to be polite.

**Practice Exercise:**

Imagine you are at a bakery in Paris. How would you greet the baker and order a croissant?

*   You: Bonjour!
*   Baker: Bonjour!
*   You: Un croissant, s'il vous plaît.
*   Baker: Oui.
*   You: Merci!
*   Baker: Au revoir!

**Cultural Insight:**

In France, it's customary to greet shopkeepers when you enter and leave a store. A simple "Bonjour" and "Au revoir" will go a long way in showing respect.

**Next Steps:**

Once you're comfortable with these basic greetings, we can move on to learning how to ask for directions and order food at a restaurant.
